Having pins render only within the radius

Pins = lat and long

set boundaries for lat and long for pins to appear, corresponding to whree the map is centered and the radius specified user

user puts in their postcode/city

we get the lat and long to center the map there

we get the radius specified by the user and drawing a circle

Use that radius add and subtradaxcting the search coordinates lat and long to find uppder and lower boundaries

e.g. searchcoordinates = lat:30 long: 10
radius is set to 10 miles

latRange = {lower: 30 - (radius converted to lat degrees), higher: 30 + (radius converted to lat degrees)}
longRange = {lower: 10 - (radius converted to long degrees), higher: 10 + (radius converted to long degrees)}

e.g. latRange (lower:29.5, higher 30.5)
longRange (lower:9.5, higher 10.5)

loop through the array of locations
only if (location lat is > lowerLat && < higherLat){
    render pin
}
